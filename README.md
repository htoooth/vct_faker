========

The goal of this project is generating large test data for hpgc(high performance graphic computing) framework. Currently, vct(china vector format) is our target. There are four versions that realize same goals. Each version uses different programming language. Here are them: ruby, python, coffeescript and livescript.

How to use

This tool is written by ruby. So you must install ruby if you want to use it. Each version must install its environment. `main.rb` require ruby environment. `main.py` require ruby environment. `coffeescript` and `livescript` require `node.js`.
